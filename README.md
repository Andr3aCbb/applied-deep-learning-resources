# applied-deep-learning-resources
Collection of research articles, blog posts and code snippets about deep learning that can be useful in applied settings. Ideally ready made models and methods which can be used out of the box. Mainly focusing on CNNs and DQNs but RNNs and other interesting things will be present as well.
